The goal of this survey is to gather statistics about people who participated in Wiki Loves Monuments, their motivations for doing so, and their opinions on the way that the competition was organised. Our goal is to use this information to improve your experience with Wiki Loves Monuments 2013, and to make the next edition of the contest even friendlier, easier, and more fun to participate in!
We will use your answers in this survey to create anonymized statistics, and will not be using, sharing or making public any personally identifiable data under any circumstances.
It takes about 5 minutes to fill out this survey, and we thank you in advance for taking the time to do so. Please note that none of the questions are obligatory, and you can refrain from answering them if you wish to.

Yours
Elke, Lodewijk, Maarten and Tomasz
Wiki Loves Monuments coordinating team, info@wikilovesmonuments.org",
